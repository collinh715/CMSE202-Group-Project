Definitions: 
    Obligate anaerobe: Will die when exposed to requisite ammount of O2.
    Obligate aerobe: Needs O2 to survive.
    Facultative anaerobe: Flourishes when exposed to O2 but does not need it to live    
    Aerotolerant anaerobes: Does not need O2 to survive and will not die when exposed to it.
    Microaerophilic: Needs abundant amounts of O2 to survive.
